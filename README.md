# Quote Dice Web App (From Idea to Delivery and Operations Learning Project)

## Project Overview
The Quote Dice Web App is an interactive application that displays inspirational or meaningful quotes on its landing page. The app combines modern web development technologies, AI, machine learning, and web crawling to provide a unique and dynamic user experience.

### Core Features
1. **Interactive Dice:**
   - A dice on the landing page that displays a new quote each time it's clicked.
   
2. **Text-Based Quote Generation:**
   - A text input box below the dice, allowing users to input text.
   - Clicking the dice generates a quote related to the entered text.

3. **AI-Powered Content:**
   - AI, machine learning, and web crawling are utilized to enrich the dataset of quotes, ensuring variety and relevance.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** .NET Core API
- **Database:** SQL Server and/or MongoDB
- **Cloud Services:** Microsoft Azure (including Azure AI services)

### Development Methodology
- **Approach:** Agile methodology
- **SDLC Stages:**
  - Planning
  - Requirements & Analysis
  - Design & Architecture
  - Implementation
  - Testing
  - Deployment
  - Operations & Maintenance

### Initial Scope
- Develop and deploy using a Windows 11 Home Edition laptop.
- Host the application on Microsoft Azure.
- Incorporate scalable AI and ML models for enhanced functionality.

### Features Planned for MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- A fully functional landing page with an interactive dice that generates random quotes.
- Text input functionality to filter or suggest quotes based on user input.
- Backend support for AI-powered quote selection.
- Basic web crawling functionality to populate the quote dataset.
