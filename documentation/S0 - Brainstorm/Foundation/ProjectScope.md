### **Project Scope: Loaded Dice App**

#### **Project Title:**

**Loaded Dice** â€“ A lightweight interactive app for boosting user motivation through inspirational quotes.

---

### **1. Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a mobile/web application that displays motivational quotes in an engaging, gamified way. The primary interface will include a digital dice and a quote display area. When a user taps or clicks the dice, a new motivational quote will be randomly generated and displayed. This application serves to help users struggling with motivation by providing quick, uplifting content.

---

### **2. Goals and Objectives**

#### **Product Objectives:**

* Develop an intuitive and interactive UI that displays a dice and motivational quote on load.
* Implement functionality that fetches and displays a new quote each time the dice is clicked.
* Support light/dark themes for improved user experience.

#### **Business Objectives:**

* Establish a replicable framework for full-cycle app development (from planning to operations).
* Explore user engagement patterns to guide future product enhancements or additional features (e.g., journaling, quote favoriting).
* Lay the groundwork for monetization through ads or in-app purchases in future versions.

### **3. Project Deliverables**

* Functional web or mobile application (React or React Native preferred).
* Backend API (Node.js/.NET Core) to serve quotes, optionally with AI-enhanced quote personalization.
* Documentation for:

  * Three-Tier Architecture explained
  * Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) followed
  * UI/UX development Framework: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test
  * API development framework research
  * Data Tier development framework research
  * Testing strategy and coverage
* Deployment on cloud platform (Azure, AWS, or Firebase).
* Basic analytics dashboard (optional phase) for tracking dice rolls and quote views.

### **4. Three-Tier Architecture**

| Stage                      | Activities                                                             |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Presentation Tier**      | Decode the UX. Display animated dice, manage themes, render quotes.    |
| **Application Logic Tier** | Decode the APIs - Data modelling, Data manipulation, Data aggregation. |
| **Data Tier**              | Data validation and storage (static or API-served quotes).             |

---

### **5. Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Stages Covered**

| Stage                        | Activities                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Planning**                 | Define app concept, user personas, goals, and tech stack.                 |
| **Requirements & Analysis**  | Gather detailed feature requirements, define data models, evaluate risks. |
| **Design & Architecture**    | Wireframes, UI mockups, component structure, backend API design.          |
| **Implementation**           | Frontend and backend development using selected frameworks.               |
| **Testing**                  | Unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing (UAT).         |
| **Deployment**               | Launch app on selected platform(s), configure CI/CD pipeline.             |
| **Operations & Maintenance** | Monitor uptime, collect feedback, push updates and bug fixes.             |

### **6. UI/UX Development Framework: Design Thinking Process**

| Phase         | Activities                                                                    |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Empathize** | Understand user needs, motivations, and pain points through persona creation. |
| **Define**    | Translate insights into problem statements and feature requirements.          |
| **Ideate**    | Brainstorm UI/UX concepts, layout options, and user flow improvements.        |
| **Prototype** | Build interactive wireframes/mockups using tools like Figma or Adobe XD.      |
| **Test**      | Conduct usability testing to refine features and interactions.                |

---

### **7. API Development Framework**

| Stage             | Activities                                                              |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Design**        | Define RESTful endpoints for quote retrieval (GET /quote, GET /quotes). |
| **Modeling**      | Specify schema for Quote objects (e.g., text, author, category).        |
| **Security**      | Add rate-limiting or API key-based access (optional for MVP).           |
| **Integration**   | Connect to external/public quote APIs or load from static dataset.      |
| **Documentation** | Use OpenAPI/Swagger to document endpoints and usage scenarios.          |

---

### **8. Data Tier Development Framework**

| Component        | Activities                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Sources** | Use static JSON files or public quote APIs (e.g., ZenQuotes, Quotable) for MVP. |
| **Validation**   | Ensure quote content is well-formed, non-empty, and properly encoded.           |
| **Storage**      | Use cloud storage (Firebase Firestore, Azure Blob, or local JSON) for quotes.   |
| **Scalability**  | Prepare data access layer for easy switch to dynamic DBs like MongoDB or SQL.   |
| **Caching**      | Optional: Implement basic caching for frequently accessed quotes.               |

---

### **9. Out of Scope (for MVP)**

* User authentication or user-specific quote history
* Social sharing features
* Offline mode
* Monetization features

---

### **10. Assumptions**

* Motivational quotes will be sourced from a public API or static file for MVP.
* Dice interaction will be animated for better UX.
* The app is initially designed for single-user interaction without persistent login.
