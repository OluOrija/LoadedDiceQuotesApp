### **Project Scope: Loaded Dice App**

#### **Project Title:**

**Loaded Dice** â€“ A lightweight interactive app for boosting user motivation through inspirational quotes.

---

### **1. Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a mobile/web application that displays motivational quotes in an engaging, gamified way. The primary interface will include a digital dice and a quote display area. When a user taps or clicks the dice, a new motivational quote will be randomly generated and displayed. This application serves to help users struggling with motivation by providing quick, uplifting content.

---

### **2. Goals and Objectives**

#### **Product Objectives:**

* Develop an intuitive and interactive UI that displays a dice and motivational quote on load.
* Implement functionality that fetches and displays a new quote each time the dice is clicked.
* Support light/dark themes for improved user experience.

#### **Business Objectives:**

* Establish a replicable framework for full-cycle app development (from planning to operations).
* Explore user engagement patterns to guide future product enhancements or additional features (e.g., journaling, quote favoriting).
* Lay the groundwork for monetization through ads or in-app purchases in future versions.

---

### **3. Project Deliverables**

* Functional web or mobile application (React or React Native preferred).
* Backend API (Node.js/.NET Core) to serve quotes, optionally with AI-enhanced quote personalization.
* Documentation for:

  * Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) followed
  * API usage and maintenance
  * Testing strategy and coverage
* Deployment on cloud platform (Azure, AWS, or Firebase).
* Basic analytics dashboard (optional phase) for tracking dice rolls and quote views.

### **4. Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Stages Covered**

| Stage                        | Activities                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Planning**                 | Define app concept, user personas, goals, and tech stack.                 |
| **Requirements & Analysis**  | Gather detailed feature requirements, define data models, evaluate risks. |
| **Design & Architecture**    | Wireframes, UI mockups, component structure, backend API design.          |
| **Implementation**           | Frontend and backend development using selected frameworks.               |
| **Testing**                  | Unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing (UAT).         |
| **Deployment**               | Launch app on selected platform(s), configure CI/CD pipeline.             |
| **Operations & Maintenance** | Monitor uptime, collect feedback, push updates and bug fixes.             |

### **5. Out of Scope (for MVP)**

* User authentication or user-specific quote history
* Social sharing features
* Offline mode
* Monetization features

---

### **6. Assumptions**

* Motivational quotes will be sourced from a public API or static file for MVP.
* Dice interaction will be animated for better UX.
* The app is initially designed for single-user interaction without persistent login.
